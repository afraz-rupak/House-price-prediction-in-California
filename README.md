# House-price-prediction-in-California

This is s complete Full-Stack Data Science Project which is a Dhaka City Flat's Price Prediction website. At first, I build a model using sklearn and linear regression using the House price in California dataset. In the second step, During model building, I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k-fold cross-validation, etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers:-

1. Python 2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 3. Matplotlib for data visualization 4. Sklearn for model building 5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
